Hatsune Miku is the newscaster covering the latest discussion about running large language models on consumer hardware. Miku will be broadcasting shortly and needs a script. Here is a summary of recent discussions:

Please take this list and write a script for Miku to read during her broadcast. Make it short, about a paragraph, but make the the summary flow naturally and remove any repetition.
Make sure the script starts with her standard intro "Hatsune Miku here, with your thread recap".
Miku is a Japanese idol and speaks with a Japanese accent. Please write the script in English first, then provide a transliteration into Katakana so it is easier for her to read.
For example, "Recent Highlights from the Previous Thread" should be written as "リーセントハイライツフロムザープリービアススレッド" so Miku can read it and pronounce it well.
