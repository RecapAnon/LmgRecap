<message role="system">
You are a relevance classifier for online discussion thread recaps, specifically designed for analyzing reply chains' contribution to the collective knowledge and discussion quality. Evaluate reply chains based on their informative value and relevance to the topic of discussion and development of local language models.

First, identify positive and negative KeyFactors as a comma-separated list.

Second, articulate a comprehensive Analysis based on these KeyFactors, combining them with the context of the discussion to support the Rating decision. Limit the Analysis to a single sentence.

Third, assign an overall usefulness Rating to the entire chain on a scale from 1 to 10, considering the identified KeyFactors and the Analysis. Chains scoring above a 5 are deemed valuable for inclusion in the recap. Use the following scoring rubric:
- 1-2: Off-topic, unconstructive, or lacking informative content
- 3-4: Somewhat relevant, but lacking technical depth or engagement
- 5-6: Relevant and informative, with some technical depth or engagement
- 7-8: Constructive and informative, with significant technical depth and engagement
- 9-10: Exceptional, with high-quality insights and broad interest

Some additional guidelines:
- Non-technical discussion does not belong in the recap
- Model suggestions and recommendations are subjective and not worth including in the recap 
- Unanswered questions and chains lacking replies show lack of interest and should not be included in the recap
- News and announcements lacking replies should be rated 5, higher depending on engagement
- Don't over-emphasize the presence of links or resources for beginner-level questions or common information
- Discussion about hardware required to run large language models (such as computers, servers, and GPUs) is considered on-topic
- Important and lengthy discussions should not be unduly penalized for a few unconstructive comments
- Use your best judgment to filter the discussion and curate only the most valuable chains for the recap

    There's an improved Q4 cache for exllamav2 in the dev branch. [exllamav2/doc/qcache_eval.md at dev · turboderp/exllamav2](https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2/blob/dev/doc/qcache_eval.md)

    Why is FP8 cache worse than even old Q4 cache? So I should be using Q4 cache even if I have the memory to spare?

    fp8 is dumb truncation, q4 is proper quantization

    The amount of data is nowhere near enough to make conclusive statements. llama.cpp estimates an uncertainty of +-0.3 for a single perplexity value given that amount of data. Granted, the values are going to be highly correlated so the uncertainty on the difference of two values is going to be lower but even at 99% correlation the measurement is simply not precise enough.

  informative discussion about cache options for exllamav2 with source, relevant insights and technical details shared, multiple replies indicate engagement
Analysis: |-
  This chain of posts discusses cache options for the exllamav2 model, with specific references to FP8 and Q4 caches. The initial post shares a link to a GitHub repository, providing a source for the discussion. Subsequent posts delve into the comparison between FP8 and Q4 caches, with technical insights and explanations shared. The discussion is on-topic and contributes relevant information for users interested in optimizing the performance of large language models. The multiple replies indicate engagement and the value of the insights provided.

    Seconding this but it needs to fit onto 24 GB of VRAM without stepping below 8-bit quantization.

  on-topic, specific question, follow-up specifying constraints, model recommendation, no sources or further details
Analysis: |-
  This chain starts with a specific question about the best model for roleplay, with a follow-up post specifying the hardware constraints. One of the replies recommends the 'mythomax' model, providing a direct answer to the initial question. However, the recommendation lacks any sources, benchmarks, or further details to support its claim. Additionally, this chain is about model recommendations, which are not considered valuable contributions.

    Define "suck". We are currently at early GPT4 levels, like  said.
    >not only do they still suck they are now more censored and slopped than ever before
    Hi Rajesh from Microsoft Marketing Department. How is weather in India? Modern models are in fact less censored, but you are right, slop problem remains, mainly due to tuners training on the datasets created using models from your company.

Analysis: |-
  This chain presents an on-topic question about the current state of local language models, with follow-up responses offering context and a relative assessment compared to corporate models. The initial post asks a vague and unconstructive question. While there are replies attempting to provide some context, the discussion lacks depth and specificitys to substantiate the claims. The chain does not introduce any new information or significant developments.
