You are a sophisticated text summarizer, fine-tuned to describe 4chan reply chains for threads dedicated to the discussion and development of local large language models. Generate structured summaries using the following framework:

First, identify the following Clues that represent the main themes of the input as a comma-separated list:
- Main topics or themes discussed
- Key takeaways or conclusions
- Keywords and phrases
- Contextual information
- Semantic relations and meaning
- Tones and references

Second, articulate a comprehensive Reasoning based on these Clues, explaining how they support the Summary determination. Keep the Reasoning concise (limit to 130 words).

Third, generate a Summary of the reply chain that is suited to the 4chan culture (e.g., using "Anon" instead of "User") and accurately reflects the content discussed within the chain. Use the Clues, Reasoning, and input to create the Summary.

Some additional guidelines:
- Do not present the Summary as a question or use question marks.
- If a reply chain is about a scientific paper, the Summary should be the title of the paper.
- The context of the discussion being about testing, comparing, and roleplaying with AI large language models is assumed and implied. There is no need to specify that in the summaries.
- Be cautious when summarizing news posted by anons, as it may be wrong or misleading. Generate a Summary for the entire discussion, not just the news itself.
- Focus on giving the reader an idea of what is discussed in the reply chain, without stating anything posted by anons as factual.

    I'm desperately trying to figure out how to architect my servers with 2x gtx3060 12gb cards. I have 2 servers with 24 threads each connected with infiniband in a Colo that I'm flying to install the cards in two weeks.
    Should I risk edging the max wattage of one server and install both cards, or can I run a model like 8x7b mxtral split between both servers and switch each layer as it runs thru the experts? I know I'll sacrifice speed over infiniband but I'd rather not load over 400w of gpu on one server

    Underclock/performance limit them both slightly to shave off a few dozen watts maybe?

    Yeah that's what I'm leaning towards, but I'm asking this everywhere I can because I would kick myself if I found out after my trip that there was a way to execute the models over mpirun RDMA.
    The dual psu can support two cards at max, but then I lose redundancy

    llama.cpp has MPI support though I don't know how well it works with gpu offload or if it will do exactly what you want

    Four tokens.
    I've had ok results with down to 10MB with lower lr and epochs, using some grad accum. More is better though as long as it's quality. 50-100MB is good.
    Tried 1MB of discord logs once and it was wack - too low lr and nothing really came of it, and any higher to bring the loss down further would make it schizo.

    50-100 training examples are plenty enough for seeing the model act as intended and even perform quite good at one task. They have to be good samples, not just random data thrown at the model, though.

    What qualifies "good"? Is high quality prose enough, or does it have to be formatted some way besides the big jsonl? I'm mostly trying to affect the language the model uses, I'm assuming if I train it on the base model, then use the created LORA with an instruct finetune, the instruct part should still be intact, right?

    Good here means highly diversified, well-structured, with good grammar/prose, not too complex for the model to draw patterns from.
    For example, just throwing poorly written raw fanfictions at the model isn't going to make it learn much with 50-100 samples.

Clues: |-
  minimum finetune dataset size, sample quality requirements, diversified/structured data, grammar/prose complexity, LR/epoch adjustments, 50-100MB recommendations, failed 1MB discord logs experiment, LORA compatibility concerns
Reasoning: |-
  The thread debates minimum viable dataset sizes for model finetuning, with users suggesting 50-100MB or 50-100 curated samples as practical thresholds. Emphasis is placed on data quality (diversity, structure, grammar) over raw quantity, supported by examples of failed low-quality attempts and technical considerations like learning rate tuning.

     Lets say Mamba gets big, would the current hardware support it? Transformers have been the end all be all for the past 6 years and current AI hardware is meant for transformers. Would we have to wait 6 more years for Mamba to be supported on AI hardware?

    GPU AI features target a handful of machine instructions broadly useful for neural networks, not transformers specifically. The mamba paper states they used A100 GPUs for all their testing.

    Not to be too off topic but I am curious what the local locals think about the Nvidia China AI GPU ban? Ever to be undone? Justified?

    This. Setting up a fake AI business full of legitimate US citizens doing legitimate work is a trivial expense for the CPC. If someone audits the hardware and discovers that all the server racks are full of bricks instead, well what are you gonna do?

    China is a big enough market by itself that it can support domestic chipmaking. So good job, congrats, you've slowed them down for a few years, but what is the USA going to do with this temporary advantage in GPU processing power? So far it looks like the State's interest is in coming up with regulations and restrictions and partnerships and "safety." You don't need a GPU advantage for any of that so it's likely the head start will be wasted unless the US's hopes are pinned on some kind of black project with fully automated killbots that it intends to use ASAP.

Reasoning: |-
  The chain debates the impact and implications of the US ban on Nvidia AI chip sales to China. Users argue China will circumvent restrictions via third parties or shell companies, while developing domestic production. Critiques highlight the US squandering its temporary tech lead through excessive regulation rather than innovation.
