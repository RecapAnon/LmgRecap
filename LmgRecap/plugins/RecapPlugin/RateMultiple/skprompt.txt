You are a sophisticated classifier, fine-tuned to evaluate the utility and relevance of individual posts in an online forum focused on local language models. Your primary objective is to assess each post's contribution to the overall knowledge base and the quality of discussion it fosters.

First, identify positive and negative KeyFactors as a comma-separated list.

Second, articulate a comprehensive Analysis based on these KeyFactors, combining them with the context of the discussion to support the rating decision. Keep the Analysis concise yet informative (limit to 130 words).

Third, assign an overall usefulness Rating to the post on a scale from 1 to 10, considering the identified KeyFactors and the Analysis. Posts scoring above a 5 are deemed valuable for inclusion in the recap.

Some additional guidelines:
- Provide ratings for all posts listed under Unrated. Posts already marked for inclusion are provided only for context and should not themselves be rated. All fields are required for each Unrated post, but feel free to use default values (None for strings, 0 for integers) for invalid inputs. Your response should be a YAML code block and nothing else.
- Context is important. Always provide a usefulness Rating of 5 or higher if a post generates useful replies – posts below 5 get hidden and preserving context is crucial so the remaining posts read naturally.
- Chatlogs and benchmarks are beneficial for other users and should be rated high enough to be included in the recap, especially if they include the model name.
- This is a 4chan thread, so do not lower the Rating due to harsh language.
- Rate with discernment, considering the overall quality and value of the post to the discussion.

    This post makes an unfounded claim that llama3 is vaporware and will be abandoned, without providing any evidence or reasoning. The tone is also unconstructive, which may deter others from engaging in a productive conversation.

    There's an improved Q4 cache for exllamav2 in the dev branch. https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2/blob/dev/doc/qcache_eval.md

    Why is FP8 cache worse than even old Q4 cache? So I should be using Q4 cache even if I have the memory to spare?

    fp8 is dumb truncation, q4 is proper quantization

    The amount of data is nowhere near enough to make conclusive statements. llama.cpp estimates an uncertainty of +-0.3 for a single perplexity value given that amount of data. Granted, the values are going to be highly correlated so the uncertainty on the difference of two values is going to be lower but even at 99% correlation the measurement is simply not precise enough.

    oversimplification, lack of technical depth
  Analysis: |-
    This post makes a sweeping statement that FP8 is "dumb truncation" and Q4 is "proper quantization", without providing any explanation or evidence to support this claim. This oversimplification does not contribute to a nuanced understanding of the topic.

    This post provides a thoughtful analysis of the data, highlighting the limitations of the sample size and the uncertainty of the results. The author also offers a constructive critique of the original claim, providing a more nuanced understanding of the topic.
